# Modular Account

Support for Modular Accounts is coming soon. Modular Accounts are based on the `EIP-6900` spec and offer a lot more flexibility and extensibility. You can read more about EIP-6900 [here](/erc-6900).

We’re currently collaborating with the community and plan to finalize the ERC soon. LightAccount is fully forward-compatible with ERC-6900. We’ll release an upgrade once the ERC is finalized.
